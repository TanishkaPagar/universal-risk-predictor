- Risk gauge meter (Low / Medium / High)
- SHAP-based explainability (top factors driving risk)
- Downloadable color-coded Excel report
- OneHotEncoding for categorical features (no false ordinal relationships)
- Comprehensive evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Confusion Matrix
- Stratified 5-Fold Cross Validation for reliable performance estimates
- Comparison of 5 imbalance-handling techniques to select the best performing method

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13
- pip

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TanishkaPagar/employee-attrition-risk-predictor.git
cd employee-attrition-risk-predictor

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📊 Model Performance

### Test Set Metrics
- Accuracy: 84.4%
- Precision: 0.513
- Recall: 0.426
- F1-Score: 0.465
- ROC-AUC: 0.782
- PR-AUC: 0.501

### Stratified 5-Fold Cross Validation
- CV F1: 0.444
- CV Recall: 0.321
- CV Precision: 0.736
- CV ROC-AUC: 0.817

### Imbalance Handling Comparison
| Method | F1 Score | Recall |
|---|---|---|
| RandomOverSampler | 0.5109 | 0.4895 |
| ADASYN | 0.4627 | 0.3421 |
| SMOTE | 0.4561 | 0.3368 |
| RandomUnderSampler | 0.4436 | 0.6895 |
| No Resampling | 0.3809 | 0.2632 |

**Best Method Selected:** RandomOverSampler (based on F1-score)

### Why Recall & Precision Matter More Than Accuracy
The dataset is imbalanced (~84% retained, ~16% attrited). A model predicting "No Attrition" for everyone would already score ~84% accuracy while being completely useless. Recall measures how many actual leavers were correctly identified, while Precision measures how many flagged high-risk predictions were correct — both are more meaningful than raw accuracy for this problem.
